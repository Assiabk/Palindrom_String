Palindrome String Checker
This is a Java program that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

The program prompts the user to enter a string, removes any non-alphanumeric characters from the string, converts it to lowercase, and then checks if the resulting string is equal to its reversed version.
